/*
Count_the_Reversals.cpp

Given a string S consisting of only opening and closing curly brackets '{' and '}', 
find out the minimum number of reversals required to convert the string into a balanced expression.
A reversal means changing '{' to '}' or vice-versa.

Input : S = "}{{}}{{{"
Output: 3

Input : S = "{{}{{{}{{}}{{"
Output: -1

Method 1: Greedy. TC: O(N) SC: O(1)
Variables: c is counter variable indicating the number of open brackets. 
res is number of reversals.

Intuition: Greedy. 
	- Whenever we get open brackets, add them. 
	- Whenever we get closing brackets and we have open ones available, 
	  just remove extra open brackets you have.
	- When we don't have enough opening brackets ,(c=0) then reverse the closing bracket 
	  we encountered immediately.
	- In the end, u may have some open brackets indicated by â€˜câ€™. 
	  Example: c=3, then we can think of resultant as {{{ , 
	  we can notice that no reversal can fix this, so return -1 when c is odd. 
	  When c is even, example c=4, {{{{ => {{}} it can be changed this way by 
	  reversing half of the open brackets. so add c/2 to the result.
